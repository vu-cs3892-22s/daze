# Docs for Front-End

To get started with the project, you will need to have installed [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) and its dependencies of `Node.js` and `npm`.

Also, for emulation purposes we need XCode for iOS emulation (need to have a Mac device, sorry Lu) and [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) + an Android device for Android emulation.
